##### The Many Faces of Robustness: A Critical Analysis of Out-of-Distribution Generalization \[[paper](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/papers/Hendrycks_The_Many_Faces_of_Robustness_A_Critical_Analysis_of_Out-of-Distribution_ICCV_2021_paper.pdf)]

- Our results show that future research must study multiple distribution shifts simultaneously, as we demonstrate that no evaluated method consistently improves robustness.
-  ImageNet-C is a diverse and systematic benchmark that is correlated with improvements on real-world corruptions.
